          First Green is a youth development charity group that enables kids to
          have an opportunity to enjoy the game of golf and build the strength
          of character that empowers them through a lifetime of new challenges.
          By seamlessly integrating the game of golf with a life skills
          curriculum, we create active learning experiences that build inner
          strength, self-confidence, and resilience that kids can carry to
          everything they do. We're building game changers through our junior
          golf programs.
